# Iris Classifier by Petal Size
Simple ML project using classification to classify the species of iris flowers by the size of their petals

### What I used
- Label encoder for the species
- Used Decision Tree Classifier

### Scores
- Since the Iris dataset is small, the model was overfitting so I used cross validation
- Average performace: ~0.96
- Variation: ~7%
- 
### Notes
- Simple project for practicing syntax
- Dataset from Kaggle: Iris Species
