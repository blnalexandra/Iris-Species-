# Iris Classifier by Petal Size
Simple ML project using classification to classify the species of iris flowers by the size of their petals

### What I used
- Label encoder for the species
- Dropped "SepalWidthCm" as it badly influences the accuracy of the model (seen on the correlation map)
- Used Logistic Regression

### Scores
- R^2 score: 1
- MAE: 0
- the model perfectly predicts the species without any mistakes

### Notes
- Simple project for practicing syntax
- Dataset from Kaggle: Iris Species
